#
# This file is based on the current x11vnc settings and can be used as
# as a ~/.x11vncrc defaults file.  If saved to another filename, these
# settings can be passed to x11vnc at startup via "-rc <filename>".
#
# The rc file comment character is "#".  Use "\#" for the literal char.
# You can continue lines using "\" as the last character of a line.
#
# Lines beginning with "#d" indicate the parameter value is at its default
# setting and you probably want to leave it commented out.
#
# Lines beginning with "#?" indicate parameters you probably do not
# want to hardwire to the current setting (uncomment if you want that).
# 
# Some parameters are boolean, e.g. -forever, and take no value; while
# the others, e.g. -wait 50, take a string or numerical value.
#
# For booleans, the line will end with comment "default: on" or
# "default: off" indicating the default setting.  (Note: often
# "-nofoobar" corresponds to option "-foobar" and the former is
# "the default", e.g. -norepeat).
#
# For string or numerical options, the value "" in a line below
# means the default is unset and you will need to supply some non-empty
# value to use the parameter.  For reference, if the default differs
# from your value it placed at the end of the line as a comment.
# 
# Feel free to uncomment or comment any of the lines or to change any
# of the values of the parameters.  Don't be surprised that most if not
# all of the lines below are commented out (x11vnc has so many parameters,
# most of them will be at their default values).
